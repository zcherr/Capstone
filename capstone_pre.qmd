## Introduction

-   This is the introduction slide (could be separated with details)
    -   Some background
    -   Rational of the project
    -   Team members and tasks
    
## Data characterization

-   Help the audience to know about the experiment and data

## Data pre-processing

-   A little more details on the data collection and features?

## Machine learning/Decoding

-   How we understand the data and interpret the neural representations

## Visualization

-   Build a clear and meaningful visualization of the brain with tagged data
-   Conclude the significance

## Just a vis demo

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Generate random data
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
data <- data.frame(
  category = factor(rep(letters[1:4], each = 50)),
  value = rnorm(200, mean = 100, sd = 15)
)

# Plot the random data
ggplot(data, aes(x = category, y = value, fill = category)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Random Data Boxplot", x = "Category", y = "Value") +
  theme_minimal()
```
